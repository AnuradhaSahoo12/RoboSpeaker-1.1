**RoboSpeaker 1.1**
RoboSpeaker 1.1 is a simple Python program that uses the os module to invoke PowerShell commands for text-to-speech functionality. The program allows users to input text, and the application will speak the entered text aloud using the systemâ€™s speech synthesizer. The program also includes a quit feature that makes the robot speak a farewell message before exiting.

**Features:
**
Text-to-speech functionality using PowerShell's speech synthesis.

**How It Works:**

****Note: This program works on Windows systems with PowerShell enabled.**
